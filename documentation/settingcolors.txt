How to set feature colors in CViT
=================================

There are many ways to set the color of a feature in CViT. The different
methods are hierarchical, with one overriding another. The methods are
listed below from lowest to highest hierarchy.

1. The glyph section in the .ini file.
     Set the color= option to establish a default color for all feature 
     displayed with that glyph.

2. A custom section in the .ini file.
     Create a custom section for a particular set of features using 
     their source and type columns (2 and 3) in the GFF file. All options
     in the corresponding glyph section can be overridden this way, not
     just color.
        [genes]
        feature = B73RefGen_v2:gene
        color = green

3. The color attribute.
     Set a color attribute for the feature in the attributes (9) column
     of the GFF. The color name must be found in the file rgb.txt, included
     in the CViT download.
        Chr1 B73RefGen_v2 gene 2345991 345119 . . . ID=some_gene;color=green
     This will override 'color' option settings in the .ini file.

4. Class colors.
     Create classes of features and let CViT pick a different color for each
     class from the class_colors list set in the .ini file. The colors will be
     taken in order from the list so it is wise to choose distinctively 
     different colors for the first colors. The color names must be found in
     the file rgb.txt. Assign a feature to a class using the attributes (9)
     column in the GFF file.
        Chr1 B73RefGen_v2 gene 2345991 345119 . . . ID=some_gene;class=gene

5. Specific class colors.
     Create classes of features and set specific colors for each class in the
     [classes] section of the GFF file.
        [classes]
        gene=green
