========================
Drawing options for CViT
========================

Almost all aspects of the output images can be controlled via the options, or
.ini file. The default file can be found inside the conf/ directory and is named
cvit.ini. This file will provide the most up-to-date and comprehensive list of options,
as options are often added with each update.

When you update CViT, be sure to also update your config files.

General or overall options

                       and size are set.
title_font           Use a built-in GD font (0=gdLargeFont, 1=gdMediumBoldFont,
                       2=gdSmallFont, 3=gdTinyFont). If title_font_face is set,
                       this setting is overridden.

                       image.

chrom_font           Use a built-in GD font (0=gdLargeFont, 1=gdMediumBoldFont,
                       2=gdSmallFont, 3=gdTinyFont). If chrom_font_face is set,
                       this setting is overridden.
chrom_font_face      Font face to use to label chromosomes, ignored if empty.
chrom_font_size      Font size for chromosome labels in points, used only in 
                       conjuction with font_face.

ruler_units          Ruler units (e.g. "cM, "kb"), used to label the ruler.
ruler_min            Minimum value on ruler, if > actual minimum value in the
                       data this will be adjusted accordingly in the code.
ruler_max            Maximum value on ruler, if < actual maximum value in the 
                       data, this will be adjusted accordingly in the code.
ruler_color          Color to use for the ruler(s).
ruler_font           Which built-in font to use (ruler_font_face overrides this
                       setting).

class_colors         Colors to use for drawing glyphs of different classes. 
                       Unless feature class colors are defined explicitly 
                       (see 'classes' below), each new class encountered in the
                       data will be assigned the next color in the list. Note
                       that features are ordered before being drawn, so unless
                       your GFF data is ordered initially, you have little 
                       control over what colors will be used for each class.
                       A feature's class is set by adding 'class=' in the 
                       attribute column (9) in the GFF file.

class                Permits setting colors to be used to draw a class of 
                       features. A feature's class is set by adding 'class='
                       in the attribute column (9) in the GFF file.

Glyph options (not all apply to all glyphs)
------------------------------------------
centromere_overhang  How much centromere bar should extend beyond chromosome bar;
                       only applies to centromere glyphs.
color                Glyph color. Can be overridend by class= attribute or 
                       color= attribute.
border_color         Color for drawing borders; only applies to borders.
transparent          Whether or not to draw glyph transparently.
shape                Glyph shape (circle, rect, or doublecircle).
width                Width of the shape.
offset               Offset glyph this many pixels from chromosome bar (negative 
                       value moves label to the left).
enable_pileup        If set to 1, CViT will offset features that overlap a
                       previously-drawn feature by shifting them right (or
                       left if on the left side of the chromosome).
pileup_gap           The space between adjacent, piled-up positions.
fill                 1=fill in area between borders, 0=don't; only applies to
                       borders and measures.
value_type           If set to 'score_col', the measure value is taken from the  
                       score column (6) in the GFF file AND IS ASSUMED TO BE AN 
                       E-VALUE. If the value in the score column is not an 
                       e-value, it will be displayed incorrectly. If set to
                       'value_attr', the measure value is in the value= 
                       attribute in the attribute (9) column. Only applies to 
                       measures.
display              If 'heat' display measure as a heat color. If 'histogram'
                       display measure as a histogram. If 'distance', the
                       distance the glyph is draw from the chromosome (right
                       or left side as indicated by offset) is determined by
                       the feature's value. Only applies to measures.
draw_as              Whether to interpret a heat map or distance measure as a
                       range, position, border, or marker.
heat_colors          Colors to use for scale (heat map only): redgreen or 
                       grayscale.
min                  Minimum value for a set of measure glyphs. If > actual 
                       minimum value in the data this will be adjusted 
                       accordingly in the code. Only applies to measures.
max                  Maximum value for a set of measure glyphs. If < actual 
                       maximum value in the data this will be adjusted 
                       accordingly in the code. Only applies to measures.
max_distance         Maximim distance to draw a distance measure.
hist_perc            Percentage of distance between chromosomes to fill with
                       maximum value for a set of histogram measure glyphs.
draw_label           Whether or not to draw label (ID= or Name= attribute)
font                 Use a built-in GD font (0=gdLargeFont, 1=gdMediumBoldFont,
                       2=gdSmallFont, 3=gdTinyFont). If font_face is set,
                       this setting is overridden.
font_face            Font face to use for label.
font_size            Font size in points, used only in conjuction with font_face.
label_offset         Start labels this many pixels right of region bar (negative 
                       value moves label to the left).
label_color          Color to use for label.


Characteristics for a custom sequence type can be defined by naming a section
by the source and type columns of the GFF. For example, the GFF record

     ZmChr1 IBM2_2008_Neighbors locus 882.70 882.70 . . . Name=tb1
     
would be identified by IBM2_2008_Neighbors:locus.

Example:

[genes]
feature = IBM2_2008_Neighbors:locus
glyph = position
color = green
offset = -5
